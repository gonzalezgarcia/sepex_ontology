# Summary of findings and discussion
| Observation      | Potential interpretation | Potential strategies |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Strong reliance on pre-scientific concepts.| Lack of critical break-throughs. | Development of an entirely a new ontology. |
| Overrepresentation of folksy terminology.| Adoption of folk terminology to describe the subject of study. | Operationalized definitions of constructs. |
| Little agreement in labelling of experimental _manipulations_. | Self-generated names biased by the researcher's own background. | Adherence to community-wide conventions (http://cognitiveatlas.org/).
| Little representation of concepts related to disorders and anatomy | Society focused on basic Experimental Psychology | Potentially interesting unexplored (or unexploited) resarch domains. New efforts to attract and foster applied science.
