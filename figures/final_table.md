# Summary of findings and discussion
| Observation      | Potential interpretation | Potential strategies |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Strong reliance on pre-scientific concepts.| Adoption of folk terminology to describe the subject of study. | Operationalized definitions of constructs. |
