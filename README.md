# Sepex ontology
Set of tools to analyze the prevalence of concepts in abstracts of SEPEX meetings

Inspired by: http://www.russpoldrack.org/2016/04/how-folksy-is-psychology-linguistic.html

To-do list:

- Figure out how to read in abstracts from SEPEX (.pdf). 
- Select prominent concepts over the years (i.e., SEPEX ontology)
- Assess overlap with classical writings in Psychology.
