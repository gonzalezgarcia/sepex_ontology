# Sepex ontology
Set of tools to analyze the prevalence of concepts in abstracts of SEPEX meetings

Inspired by: http://www.russpoldrack.org/2016/04/how-folksy-is-psychology-linguistic.html

To-do list:

- (DONE) ~~Figure out how to read in abstracts from SEPEX (.pdf).~~
- Select prominent concepts over the years (i.e., SEPEX ontology): need to figure out how to get rid of irrelevant words
- Assess overlap with classical writings in Psychology and with cognitive atlas. 
Perhaps, we could have a 3x3  matrix with SEPEX - Cognitive Atlas - William James and % overlap as DV
- (DONE) ~~visualize prominent concepts in SEPEX, CA and WJ. Maybe word cloud??~~
- Check overlap of SEPEX with cogatlas and other lexicons such as DSM or something more neurosciency
